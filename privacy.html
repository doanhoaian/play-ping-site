                This Application Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the information that Dihaver Tech (“Developer”, “We”,
                “Us”, or “Our”) gathers, how we use that information, and the options you have to access, correct, or
                delete such information when you use the PlayPing Android application (the “Application”).
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm opacity-80">
                Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the applicable
                Terms of Service.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Scope of Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to provide developers, testers,... with robust network testing tools while maintaining the
                highest standards of data integrity and user privacy. To earn and maintain your trust, we commit to
                communicating transparently regarding the technical operations of our network simulation features.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Policy applies solely to the Developer’s collection, use, and disclosure of data in connection with
                the use of the Application. This Policy does not apply to third-party websites, services, or
                applications that you may access through the Application, which are governed by their own respective
                privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                We adhere to the principle of data minimization. We only collect and process the data strictly required
                to operate the Application’s simulation features, ensure stability, and support the advertising model
                that keeps the Application free.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three categories of data that we collect: Operational Data, Advertising Data, and Feedback Data.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 Operational Data (Technical & Device)</h3>
            <p>
                When you use the Application, we automatically collect specific technical data required for the
                Application to function on your specific hardware. This data is pseudonymized and generally cannot be
                used to directly identify you as an individual.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Advertising Data</h3>
            <p>
                To provide the Application free of charge, we monetize via Appodeal and its partner ad networks. These
                partners may collect data to serve relevant advertisements.
            </p>
            <table>

                        <td>We and our partners use the Google Advertising ID (GAID) to manage ad frequency (capping),
                            track ad conversions, and detect fraud. You can reset this ID in your Android device
                            settings.</td>
                    </tr>

                            appropriate advertisements. We do not collect precise GPS coordinates.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>2.3 Feedback Data (Voluntary)</h3>
            <p>
                We do not require user account registration. However, if you choose to submit feedback or bug reports
                via the Application:

            <h2>3. Network Simulation & VpnService Disclosure</h2>
            <div class="rounded-xl border border-zinc-800/80 bg-zinc-950/60 p-4 mb-4">
                <p class="mt-0 mb-2 font-semibold text-zinc-200">This section is critical for understanding how the Application functions regarding Android’s VpnService API.</p>
                <p class="text-sm m-0">
                    The Application utilizes the Android <code>VpnService</code> class to create a local, virtual network interface.
                    This is the core mechanism allowing PlayPing to simulate network conditions (packet loss, high latency, disconnection) without requiring root access.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <ul class="mt-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Processing:</strong> The majority of traffic interception and manipulation occurs
                    locally on your device. The Application acts as a "loopback" to delay or drop packets based on your
                    configuration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Content Inspection:</strong> The Application does not decrypt, read, store, or analyze
                    the content (payload) of your network traffic (e.g., passwords, messages, emails).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Connectivity Maintenance:</strong> In limited scenarios, to prevent total connectivity
                    failure during complex simulations, traffic may be routed through intermediary relay servers. These
                    servers function strictly as data conduits; they do not log traffic content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Not a VPN for Privacy:</strong> The Application is a developer tool for testing, not a
                    consumer VPN designed for anonymity or bypassing geo-restrictions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We process the collected data for the following specific legal bases and purposes:</p>

                    14) and release stability patches.</li>
                <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> To display advertisements via Appodeal, allowing us to maintain the
                    Application infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations or valid law enforcement
                    requests.</li>
            </ul>
